🚀 Jenkins Docker CI Pipeline for MERN Application

This project demonstrates a real-world CI (Continuous Integration) pipeline using Jenkins and Docker for a MERN stack application.
The pipeline automatically builds Docker images for both frontend and backend services and pushes them to Docker Hub using secure credentials.

📌 Project Overview

In modern DevOps workflows, applications are packaged as Docker images and built automatically using CI pipelines.
This project shows how Jenkins can be used to:

Pull source code from GitHub

Build Docker images for a MERN application

Authenticate securely with Docker Hub

Push Docker images automatically

This pipeline focuses on CI only (build & push). Deployment is intentionally separated as a future step.

⚙️ Jenkins Pipeline Stages
1️⃣ Checkout Source Code

Jenkins pulls the latest code from GitHub.

Reads the Jenkinsfile to execute pipeline steps.

2️⃣ Build Backend Docker Image

Uses the backend Dockerfile

Builds the image:

thisandaprasanjana/backend:latest

3️⃣ Build Frontend Docker Image

Uses a multi-stage Docker build

Builds the image:

thisandaprasanjana/frontend:latest

4️⃣ Login to Docker Hub

Uses Jenkins credentials (username + access token)

Credentials are masked for security

5️⃣ Push Images to Docker Hub

Pushes both images to Docker Hub automatically

🐳 Docker Images

The pipeline publishes the following images:

Backend

thisandaprasanjana/backend:latest


Frontend

thisandaprasanjana/frontend:latest


Images are publicly available on Docker Hub and can be pulled from any machine.

▶️ Run the Application (Optional)

You can run the images locally using Docker:

docker run -d -p 5000:5000 thisandaprasanjana/backend:latest
docker run -d -p 3000:80 thisandaprasanjana/frontend:latest


Or use Docker Compose (recommended for multi-container setup).

🔐 Security Practices

Docker Hub credentials are stored securely in Jenkins

Secrets are not hardcoded in the repository

Passwords are masked in Jenkins logs

🎯 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned:

How Jenkins CI pipelines work in real projects

How to Dockerize frontend and backend services

Secure credential management in Jenkins

Automating Docker image builds and pushes

CI best practices for MERN applications

🚀 Future Improvements

Add Docker Compose based deployment

Implement automatic deployment stage (CD)

Move pipeline to Linux-based Jenkins agent

Kubernetes deployment using Helm

GitHub Webhook for auto-triggered builds
